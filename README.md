## /Featurae/:
- <b>*Overcoming innate limitations & enchancing general functionality of Windows' clipbuffer.*</b>

- Multitask data viewing system with no limits about simultaneous window opening.
- Unobtrusive PreXP-stylish design with optional opacity and border snapping.
- Raw text, HTML, bitmap, RTF, metaimage and path listings support.
- Up to ten hotslots for rapid multipasting emulation (Ctrl+[0-9]).
- Plain .INI-based settings storage with no access to registry ever.
- Asynchronous search engine with regexp and reparsing support.
- Intercessional data preservation within single dedicated file.
- Consistent runtime autocompression for all absorbed data.
- Basic Drag/Drop support for outside communications.
- RUS<->ENG rapid xlat conversion (hotkey available).
- Complete Unicode-compilancy.

## /Reassembling/:
**SlipperyClip** is written completely in PureBasic v5.30 with few fixes for v5.24 compatibility.  
It relies on single dependency: COMate+ by nxSoftWare.  
To compile project use 'Main.pb' as root sourcefile.
