## /Sum/:
**Slippery Clip** is an optimized and portable clipboard management utility, mostly powered by minimalistic GUI with maximum keyboard support in mind. It provides easy-to-use storage mechanism for logging and processing any data sent to clipboard, complete with hotkey-based multipasting functionality.  

## /Featuræ/:
- <b>*Overcoming innate limitations & enchancing general functionality of Windows' clipbuffer.*</b>  
- Rather vast array of hotkeys, rendering ~80% of functionally to be accessible from keyboard.
- XCopy-based installation process. Single ‘SlipperyClip.exe’ is enough for functioning.
- Multitask data viewing system with no limits about simultaneous window opening.
- Unobtrusive PreXP-stylish design with optional opacity and border snapping.
- Raw text, HTML, bitmap, RTF, metaimage and path listings support.
- Up to ten hotslots for rapid multipasting emulation (Ctrl+[0-9]).
- Plain .INI-based settings storage with no access to registry ever.
- Asynchronous search engine with regexp and reparsing support.
- Intercessional data preservation within single dedicated file.
- Consistent runtime autocompression for all absorbed data.
- Basic Drag/Drop support for outside communications.
- RUS<->ENG rapid xlat conversion (hotkey available).
- Complete Unicode-compilancy.

## /Reassembling/:
**SlipperyClip** is written completely in [PureBasic v5.30](http://www.purebasic.com) with few fixes for v5.24 and v5.40 compatibility.  
It relies on single external dependency: _COMate+_ by nxSoftWare (bundled in repository).  
To rubild - compile `Main.pb` as root sourcefile.
